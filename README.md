# AWS Solutions Architect Projects

#### In an effort to harness the full potential of cloud computing, I have embarked on a series of projects utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) to design, implement, and optimize various cloud-based solutions. These projects highlight a diverse range of AWS services and demonstrate my ability to tackle complex cloud infrastructure challenges. Below is a brief overview of each project:

1.- Using an ALB behind Amazon CloudFront with Custom HTTP Headers for Access Control
This project focuses on enhancing web application security by using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) behind Amazon CloudFront, incorporating custom HTTP headers to control and restrict access.

2.- Standing Up an Amazon Aurora Database with Automatic Password Rotation via AWS Secrets Manager
Here, I deployed an Amazon Aurora database with automated password management using AWS Secrets Manager, ensuring enhanced security and streamlined credential handling.

3-. Blue/Green Deployments with Elastic Beanstalk
This initiative implements Blue/Green deployment strategies using Elastic Beanstalk, enabling seamless application updates with minimal downtime and risk.

4.- Creating a CloudTrail Trail and EventBridge Alert for Console Sign-Ins
To boost security monitoring, I set up AWS CloudTrail to log console sign-ins and integrated it with Amazon EventBridge to trigger real-time alerts.

5.- Creating a Custom AMI and Deploying an Auto Scaling Group behind an Application Load Balancer
This project involved creating a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and configuring an Auto Scaling group behind an ALB, ensuring efficient load distribution and scalability.

6.- Simulating Recovery of Deleted Files in S3 Using Versioning
Demonstrating data recovery techniques, I simulated the recovery of deleted files in Amazon S3 by leveraging versioning capabilities.

7.- Using Secrets Manager for RDS Database Authentication with AWS Lambda
I developed a solution where AWS Lambda functions authenticate with an RDS database using credentials securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

8.- Deploying a Serverless Application with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB
This serverless application deployment project utilized AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to create a scalable and cost-effective backend system.

9.- Standing Up an Apache Web Server EC2 Instance and Sending Logs to Amazon CloudWatch
In this comprehensive project, I launched an Apache Web Server on an EC2 instance and configured it to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and analysis.

10.- Assigning Static IPs to NLBs with ALB Target Groups
This project addressed network management by assigning static IPs to Network Load Balancers (NLBs) while configuring ALB target groups for optimized traffic routing.

11.- Hosting a WordPress Application on ECS Fargate with RDS, Parameter Store, and Secrets Manager
This project involved hosting a WordPress application on Amazon ECS Fargate, integrating it with an RDS database, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and Secrets Manager for secure configuration and credential management.

12.- Sending VPC Flow Logs to S3 and Parsing the Logs via Amazon Athena
I implemented a solution to send VPC Flow Logs to Amazon S3 and used Amazon Athena to parse and analyze the logs, gaining insights into network traffic and security.

Through these projects, I have gained a deep understanding of AWS services and best practices, demonstrating my capability to design robust, secure, and scalable cloud architectures.
