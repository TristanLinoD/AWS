## Simulating Recovery of Deleted Files in S3 Using Versioning

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab we have been asked to implement an architecture to help accidental or purposeful deletion of important company files stored in Amazon S3.
So we are going to explore deletion protection options for your Amazon S3 bucket, enable versioning for all files within the S3 bucket, and test deletion and recovery of test files.

### Objectives

- Create Test Files
- Delete Objects - Part 1
- Enable Versioning for Amazon S3 Bucket
- Delete Objects - Part 2
